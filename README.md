# feel_good

This app will take the users choice of feelings(sad, happy, unloved) and give them a moving quote to improve their feelings ;)

A simple app utilising a lot of new elements learned.

Using Kivy to build the front end of the app and style various elements of each screen.

Using Object Orientated Classes to program each button on each screen including login, account creation and take in user inputs.
